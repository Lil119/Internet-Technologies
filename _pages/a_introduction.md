Next.js is a React-based framework that makes it easy to create fast, high-performance websites. It allows pages to load in advance, speeding up display times and improving SEO because pages are visible to search engines right from the start. Page and link management is automatic, simplifying navigation. Next.js also includes performance optimizations like optimized image loading.
