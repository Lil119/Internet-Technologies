# Introduction

The first part of this tutorial is heavily based on the tutorial of Derek Turner on how to install React : https://derekturner.github.io/IT-docs-24/#/Block_REACT/section_5/reactDevelopment1?id=dockervite-client-side-app.

If you already know about it, you can skip the first part and go directly to the "Installing Next.js" section.
